# What is Pea.js?

Peajs is a extended framework based on the re-encapsulation of koa. It enables developer to concentrate on development and get rid of other tedious basic work.

# Why you should try Pea.js?
With the development going on, we found a fact that enormous basic work is duplicated across various projects. For instance, we have to integrate log module, eslint, api document module, etc. by copy-paste, which is lavishing the time of not only migration but also extra debug. Yet if we donâ€™t integrate them prior to kicking off development (due to the tight schedule of project), more and more effort of refactoring and communication would have to be spent.

# Quick Start
